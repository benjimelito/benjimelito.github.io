        <p>Hi, my name is Ben. A little about myself: I'm 27 years old and live in Brighton with 2 roommates, I am originally from Belmont, and I went to school at Colorado College.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a commmunity manager at Pingup, which is a starup in South Boston. Before doing that I mentored kids in Boston for a company called Arbour Counseling Services.  </p>
        <p>Alright, so I guess this is where I talk about my interests. In the summer I enjoy following the ups and downs of the Red Sox, playing tennis, and going to the beach. As for indoor activities I like listening to <a href="http://hypem.com/benjimelito">music</a> (Electro-pop, Indie, EDM, etc.) and watching TV, my favorite shows being Mad Men, Game of Thrones, and Girls (which I occasionally get ridiculed for).</p>
